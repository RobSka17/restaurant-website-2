# Restaurant Website 2

This project revisits a project I made back in 2021 - A simple restaurant website design hosted on a Node Express server. The aim is to produce essentially the same app but with an improved stack. The original project used simple static HTML files, Bootstrap and jQuery, and serves those files via Express static middleware. This updated version of that project uses a React/Vite/Express stack, ditching use of Bootstrap and jQuery.

Start Vite dev server: `npm run dev`

Start Node Express server:

`npm run build`

`npm start`
